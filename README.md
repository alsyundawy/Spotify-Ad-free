### How to Debug problems?

Spotify comes with a hidden debug console. You can start Spotify via `spotify --show-console` command line parameter in order to start/reveal the console window.



### Spotify (app) privacy

You can easily import the "blocker" (filters) list into any Ad-blocker or download the pre-made Ad-Free versions. A HOSTS file is not a "crack" and not something you get banned for while using it.

An additional advice is to set the following parameters within the Spotify app:

- Edit - Preferences (CTRL + P) - Privacy _Block all cookies..._ (enable it)
- Edit - Preferences (CTRL + P) - Advertisement - Change advertising preferences (disable everything here on the Spotify website)
- Manually delete the Spotify cache folder and mark it as _read-only_so that Spotify won't get access tp it, which prevents to store meta-data and ads in it.

This helps to get rid of [cookie leftover(s) tracker(s)](https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/eqzg51/what_about_the_privacy_of_my_data_in_spotify/) and reduces the chance to see banner ads (it does not remove them!).


### Release & RePack information

I do _not officially maintain this project_ which means every work I still do is for the community only and entirely for free. I spent a lot of time debugging and inspecting Spotify's traffic.

No one is forced to download something from the [release tab](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/Spotify-Ad-free/releases) nor do I support something illegal here. Repacking the installer is not illegal, however modifying the files itself is because it's against ToS (which I respect) but including several additional patches and a HOSTS file seems pretty much okay because Spotify does include already anti-blocking debugging techniques to prevent all of this. Abusing "holes" is illegal.

In this repo I provide:
- Ad-Free mods for Desktops and the Android OS. MacOS is official not supported because I don't use any Apple products.
- Filter lists in order to block ads (via hosts).
